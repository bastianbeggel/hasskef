## Discussion
See [home assistant thread](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/kef-ls50-wireless/)


### Use in Home Assistant
1. Create folder in your home assistant main folder:
```bash
mkdir custom_components/media_player
```
2. Copy pykef.py and kefwireless.py into that folder. This will make the custom component kefwireless available to Home Assistant: 
```bash
cp pykef.py custom_components/media_player
cp kefwireless.py custom_components/media_player
```
3. Add component to Home Assistant by adding to configuration.yaml and restart HA:
```bash
media_player:
   - platform: kefwireless
     host: 192.168.x.x # change to the IP of you speaker, no autodetection yet
     name: MyLS50W # optional, the name you want to see in Home Assistant 
```

##Limitations
- LS50 speakers take about 20 seconds to boot. Thus, after turning them on please be patient. Turning them on via HA is not possible.
